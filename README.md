# 50.002_1D_Checkoff1
50.002 Computation Structures 1D Project Checkoff 1 (Class CI03 Group 1)
This project includes implementation of16-bit ALU design on an FPGA and test codes for the functionality of the 16-bit ALU. To make the testing easier and clearer, we encapsulate the testing part into a tester which includes a case ROM and a driver.
